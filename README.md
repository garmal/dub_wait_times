# dub_wait_times
Scraper to determine DUB Airport security wait times.

Horrified by stories of 4 hour wait times and missed flights, and expecting to fly the following week, I setup a script to gather the DAA published wait times from their website so I can plan my journey to the airport appropriately.
Run a cronjob every X minutes to gather data.
